# Floyd-Warshall algorithm
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can calculate all the distances in weighted graph really fast. This program uses a 2D map of roads (true) and walls (false), so it doesn't use weights.
I wrote a blog article about this at https://johetajava.hu/programozas/2020/floyd-warshall-java/
